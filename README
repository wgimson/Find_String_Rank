find_str_rank finds the lexicographically first and last ranked words in a 
series entered by the user and prints these. The prompt is repeated until the
user enters a word of four letters in length. Three array data structures are 
used, one to represent the current last word at any given time, one to represent
the current first word, and one to temporarily store the latest word to be 
fetched before its rank can be determined. At the first iteration, the word
entered by the user will be both the first and last ranked word. After that 
there will be divergence. Words have a maximum length of 20 characters, defined
by a macro, and while the user's input exceeds this length, he/she is prompted 
to reenter. The C Library functions strcpy(), strcmp() and strlen() are used to
copy strings into max_word and min_word, compare strings lexicogrphically and 
determine whether a string of four letters has been entered by the user, 
respectively. The function read_str() reads user input into the character array
usr_str for temporary storage. It accepts a character string parameter and an
integer, representing the maximum length of the word. read_str() reads a word
one character at a time into the passed character array using the getchar()
function.
